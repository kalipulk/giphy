# giphy

This application uses JavaScript and aJax calls to populate a variety of gifs through buttons, as well as user inputs. 

When a user selects one of the buttons, a pre-set number of gifs pertaining to that theme will populate the page. The user also has the option to select their own category, and the application will then push their gifs to the viewing area.
